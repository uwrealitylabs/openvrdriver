# Drivers

SteamVR is the only widely universal VR platform with accessible driver SDKs (from Valve's OpenVR), making it an easy choice for an open-source VR project. This repository contains the drivers the team uses for the Reality from Scratch HMD. We use it in conjuction with the [FastIMU](https://github.com/LiquidCGS/FastIMU) Arduino library from LiquidCGS.
